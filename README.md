# bui_project2

Uses the Play framework and Bovada API to supply sports lines and allow users to take bets. Since it's dependent on SQL connection (using jdbc driver) I supplied a template on index.html if you would like to view. Otherwise, runs on java 1.8. Can install dependencies with sbt, and run with sbt (navigate to localhost:9000)
